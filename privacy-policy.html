    <h1>Privacy Policy for G Flow</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: 12/14/2023</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to G Flow ("us," "we," or "our"). This Privacy Policy is designed
      to help you understand how G Flow accesses and displays Gmail messages and
      Google Calendar events within your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection and Usage</h2>

    <p>
      G Flow accesses your Gmail messages and Google Calendar events within the
      confines of your browser to provide a seamless popup interface for your
      convenience. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user
      data, including Gmail messages, Calendar events, or personal information,
      to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Chrome Authentication and API Access</h2>

    <p>
      To enable G Flow to access Gmail and Google Calendar, the extension
      requires you to be logged into Chrome. G Flow utilizes your Chrome
      authentication token to access the Gmail and Google Calendar APIs. This
      token is solely used for the purpose of fetching your Gmail messages and
      Calendar events to display them within the extension.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Displayed to the User</h2>

    <p>
      G Flow displays your Gmail messages, Google Calendar events, and your
      email address within the extension interface. It's important to note that
      this information is not sent or tracked outside of your local browser. G
      Flow operates solely within your browser, and all data remains on your
      computer.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>
      G Flow may utilize Chrome storage for local storage purposes, enhancing
      your experience by remembering certain preferences or settings. This
      storage is entirely local and does not involve the transmission of data to
      external servers. We prioritize the security of your data and ensure that
      all operations are performed within the confines of your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      G Flow may update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes in its
      practices. Any updates will be effective immediately upon posting.
    </p>
